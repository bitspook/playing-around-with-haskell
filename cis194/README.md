# CIS194

Solutions for [CIS194 Haskell
course](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) solved while
doing BDD using Hspec.

You must have [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) installed
before you can run the tests. Solutions aren't written lecture wise, but are
divided in modules per problem-domain as it made sense to me.

Reference: [Tutorial on getting started with
HSpec](https://www.stackbuilders.com/tutorials/haskell/bdd-in-haskell-with-hspec/)
I used.

Just execute `stack test` to execute the tests.
